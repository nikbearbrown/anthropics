# Module M-02 — Probability, Normalization, and Expectation Values
*Understanding what* $|\psi(x)|^2$ *represents and how to work with it.*

The Born rule tells us that $|\psi(x,t)|^2$ is the probability density for finding a particle at position $x$. The key word here is "density." A density evaluated at a single point is not a probability — it is a density. The probability lives in the integral over a region.

This module develops the probability tools that Born's rule requires: probability densities, normalization, expectation values, and standard deviations. These concepts appear throughout the quantum mechanics that follows, expressed in $\psi$ notation.

## Probability Density versus Probability

For a continuous random variable $X$, a **probability density function** (PDF) $f(x)$ satisfies:

$$f(x) \geq 0, \qquad \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)\,dx = 1.$$

The probability that $X$ falls in the interval $[a, b]$ is

$$P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx.$$

There are three important points to keep in mind. First, $f(x)$ is not itself a probability — it is a density, and it can exceed 1. For example, $f(x) = 2$ for $x\in[0, \frac{1}{2}]$ and zero elsewhere is a perfectly valid PDF. Second, the probability of finding $X$ at exactly one specific value $x_0$ is zero. Only intervals carry nonzero probability. Third, the integral of $f$ over any interval is a number between 0 and 1; the function $f$ itself is not so constrained.

This distinction is fundamental when applying Born's rule. The probability of finding the particle at the single point $x_0$ is zero — not $|\psi(x_0)|^2$. The probability of finding it between $x_0$ and $x_0 + dx$ is $|\psi(x_0)|^2\,dx$ — a density times a width. Normalization requires integrating the density to one, not setting the density equal to one at some point.

## Mean, Expectation Value, and Variance

The **mean** (expectation value) of $X$ is the probability-weighted average:

$$\mu \equiv \langle X\rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x\,f(x)\,dx.$$

The expectation of any function $g(X)$ is:

$$\langle g(X)\rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x)\,f(x)\,dx.$$

Expectation is **linear**: $\langle aX + b\rangle = a\langle X\rangle + b$ for any constants $a$, $b$. This follows directly from linearity of the integral and does not require any special property of $f$.

The **variance** measures spread as the mean squared deviation from the mean:

$$\sigma^2 = \langle(X - \mu)^2\rangle = \langle X^2\rangle - \langle X\rangle^2.$$

The second form — "mean of the square minus the square of the mean" — comes from expanding $(X-\mu)^2 = X^2 - 2\mu X + \mu^2$ and taking the expectation:

$$\langle X^2 - 2\mu X + \mu^2\rangle = \langle X^2\rangle - 2\mu\langle X\rangle + \mu^2 = \langle X^2\rangle - 2\mu^2 + \mu^2 = \langle X^2\rangle - \mu^2.$$

The **standard deviation** $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$ has the same units as $X$ and is the natural measure of the width of a distribution.

The mean is not the same as the most probable value. For a symmetric, unimodal distribution they coincide — and many textbook examples are symmetric — but for asymmetric distributions they can differ substantially. The expectation value $\langle x\rangle$ is the probability-weighted average position, not the location where $|\psi|^2$ peaks.

## The Gaussian Integral

The most frequently used integral in normalization and expectation-value calculations is

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\alpha x^2}\,dx = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}}, \qquad \alpha > 0.$$

To derive this, let $I = \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-\alpha x^2}dx$. We square it:

$$I^2 = \left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-\alpha x^2}dx\right)\!\left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-\alpha y^2}dy\right) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-\alpha(x^2+y^2)}\,dx\,dy.$$

Switching to polar coordinates with $x^2+y^2 = r^2$ and $dx\,dy = r\,dr\,d\theta$, where $r\in[0,\infty)$ and $\theta\in[0,2\pi)$:

$$I^2 = \int_0^{2\pi}d\theta\int_0^\infty e^{-\alpha r^2}r\,dr = 2\pi\cdot\frac{1}{2\alpha} = \frac{\pi}{\alpha}.$$

The $r$-integral follows via $u = \alpha r^2$: $\int_0^\infty e^{-\alpha r^2}r\,dr = 1/(2\alpha)$. Therefore $I = \sqrt{\pi/\alpha}$.

Two extensions follow by differentiating with respect to $\alpha$:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 e^{-\alpha x^2}\,dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2\alpha^{3/2}}, \qquad \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^4 e^{-\alpha x^2}\,dx = \frac{3\sqrt{\pi}}{4\alpha^{5/2}}.$$

Odd-powered integrands $x^{2n+1}e^{-\alpha x^2}$ vanish by symmetry — the integrand is an odd function on a symmetric domain.

## Delta-Function Normalization for Plane Waves

The plane wave $\psi_k(x) = e^{ikx}$ is not square-integrable — $\int|e^{ikx}|^2\,dx = \int dx$ diverges. Free-particle states cannot be normalized with a finite constant. They are handled by **Dirac-delta normalization**:

$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{ik'x}e^{-ikx}\,dx = 2\pi\,\delta(k'-k),$$

or, with the convention $\psi_k(x) = e^{ikx}/\sqrt{2\pi}$: $\langle\psi_{k'}|\psi_k\rangle = \delta(k'-k)$.

The delta function replaces the Kronecker delta of discrete bound states: $\langle m|n\rangle = \delta_{mn}$ for a complete orthonormal basis of bound states becomes $\langle k'|k\rangle = \delta(k'-k)$ for free-particle states. Physical observables involve wave packets rather than individual plane waves. A wave packet $\psi(x) = \int\phi(k)e^{ikx}dk/\sqrt{2\pi}$ normalized in position space ($\int|\psi|^2\,dx = 1$) has $\phi(k)$ normalized in momentum space ($\int|\phi|^2\,dk = 1$) by Parseval's theorem. Each plane wave contributes to the integral with weight $|\phi(k)|^2$; no individual plane wave is a physical state, but the superposition is.

## Worked Example: The Gaussian Wave Packet

The Gaussian is the central example in quantum mechanics because it minimizes the product $\Delta x\,\Delta p$. Computing its normalization and standard deviation illustrates the template for every expectation-value calculation.

**The wave function.** We take

$$\psi(x) = N\,e^{-x^2/(4\sigma^2)},$$

where $\sigma$ is a given length scale and $N$ is the normalization constant to be determined.

**Normalization.** We compute $\int|\psi|^2\,dx = N^2\int e^{-x^2/(2\sigma^2)}\,dx$. Applying the Gaussian integral with $\alpha = 1/(2\sigma^2)$:

$$N^2\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{1/(2\sigma^2)}} = N^2\sigma\sqrt{2\pi} = 1 \implies N = \frac{1}{(2\pi\sigma^2)^{1/4}}.$$

**Mean position.** The integrand $x|\psi|^2 = N^2 x\,e^{-x^2/(2\sigma^2)}$ is an odd function of $x$ on the symmetric domain $(-\infty, \infty)$. The integral vanishes: $\langle x\rangle = 0$.

**Mean squared position.** Applying $\int x^2 e^{-\alpha x^2}\,dx = \sqrt{\pi}/(2\alpha^{3/2})$ with $\alpha = 1/(2\sigma^2)$:

$$\langle x^2\rangle = N^2\cdot\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2(1/(2\sigma^2))^{3/2}} = \frac{1}{(2\pi\sigma^2)^{1/2}}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}\cdot(2\sigma^2)^{3/2} = \sigma^2.$$

**Standard deviation.** $\Delta x = \sqrt{\langle x^2\rangle - \langle x\rangle^2} = \sqrt{\sigma^2 - 0} = \sigma$.

The width parameter $\sigma$ in the exponent of the Gaussian is the standard deviation of the position distribution. The Gaussian is the minimum-uncertainty state: its momentum-space wavefunction $\phi(k)$ (the Fourier transform of $\psi(x)$) is also Gaussian with width $1/(2\sigma)$, giving $\Delta p = \hbar/(2\sigma)$ and therefore $\Delta x\,\Delta p = \sigma\cdot\hbar/(2\sigma) = \hbar/2$ — the lower bound in the uncertainty principle.

## Normalization Is Preserved in Time

The Schrödinger equation with a Hermitian Hamiltonian $\hat{H} = \hat{H}^\dagger$ preserves normalization: if $\int|\psi(x,0)|^2\,dx = 1$, then $\int|\psi(x,t)|^2\,dx = 1$ for all $t$. The proof uses the continuity equation — the probability current $j = (\hbar/2mi)(\psi^*\partial_x\psi - \psi\partial_x\psi^*)$ satisfies $\partial_t|\psi|^2 + \partial_x j = 0$, and integrating over all space with $j\to0$ at $\pm\infty$ gives $d/dt\int|\psi|^2\,dx = 0$.

This means normalization is an initial condition, not something we must re-impose at every time step. Approximation methods or numerical truncations can violate it; checking that $\int|\psi|^2\,dx$ remains 1 after an approximation is a useful diagnostic.

## Where This Appears in the Quantum Series

**Vol. I, Ch. 3 — Born's rule.** The entire chapter is the continuous-distribution formalism of this module applied to $|\psi|^2$: the probability of finding the particle in $[a,b]$ is $\int_a^b|\psi|^2\,dx$; the expectation value of position is $\langle x\rangle = \int x|\psi|^2\,dx$; normalization is $\int|\psi|^2\,dx = 1$. The complex modulus $|\psi|^2 = \psi^*\psi$ requires the complex-number tools of M-01.

**Vol. I, Ch. 9 — The uncertainty principle.** The quantities $\Delta x$ and $\Delta p$ in $\Delta x\,\Delta p \geq \hbar/2$ are standard deviations of position and momentum distributions:

$$(\Delta x)^2 = \langle x^2\rangle - \langle x\rangle^2, \qquad (\Delta p)^2 = \langle p^2\rangle - \langle p\rangle^2.$$

This is $\sigma^2 = \langle X^2\rangle - \langle X\rangle^2$ from this module, applied twice. The Gaussian saturates the bound because the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is a Gaussian, and Fourier transform pairs obey the product inequality $\Delta x\,\Delta k \geq 1/2$ as a theorem of harmonic analysis.

**Vol. IV, Ch. 1 — Measurement theory.** The expectation value of a general observable $\hat{A}$ in state $\psi$ is $\langle\hat{A}\rangle = \langle\psi|\hat{A}|\psi\rangle = \int\psi^*(x)\hat{A}\psi(x)\,dx$. The squared uncertainty is $(\Delta A)^2 = \langle\hat{A}^2\rangle - \langle\hat{A}\rangle^2$ — exactly the variance formula $\sigma^2 = \langle X^2\rangle - \mu^2$. Observable measurement in QM is continuous-distribution probability theory in function-space notation.

(c) The plane wave $\psi_k(x) = e^{ikx}/\sqrt{2\pi}$ is not in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ but satisfies $\langle k'|k\rangle = \delta(k'-k)$. Compute $\langle k'|k\rangle$ explicitly by evaluating $\int\psi_{k'}^*(x)\psi_k(x)\,dx$ and identifying the result as a Dirac delta. (d) Explain in one sentence why individual plane waves are not physical states but wave packets are.

## Quick Practice

1. Show that $f(x) = 1/(\pi(1+x^2))$ (the Cauchy-Lorentz distribution) is normalized. Then attempt to compute $\langle x\rangle = \int x/(\pi(1+x^2))\,dx$. What goes wrong, and what does this tell you about whether every normalized distribution has a finite mean?

2. For the wave function $\psi(x) = Ne^{-\alpha|x|}$ with $\alpha > 0$: find $N$ by normalization, compute $\langle x\rangle$ and $\langle x^2\rangle$ by explicit integration (split the domain at $x=0$), and give $\Delta x$.

3. A two-state superposition $\psi = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\psi_1 + \psi_2)$, where $\langle\psi_m|\psi_n\rangle = \delta_{mn}$ and $\hat{H}\psi_n = E_n\psi_n$. Show $\psi$ is normalized. Compute $\langle\hat{H}\rangle$ and $(\Delta H)^2$. The variance is nonzero even though each $\psi_n$ is an energy eigenstate — explain physically what this means about a measurement of energy on this state.
